Tower Health has been engaged in Medicare-based NPRA since the inception of the CJR program on April 1, 2016, as it was selected as a mandatory participating hospital. The system has gained valuable experience in partnering with its independent orthopedic surgeons to share the NPRA savings and believes that such an arrangement has helped facilitate greater alignment between the physicians and the hospital. BH will utilize these proven processes and policies with other service lines as it engages with physicians in new CMS bundled payment programs.",,,

1944-0000,54.0,"There have been no unexpected positive or negative outcomes. Positive outcomes have been associated with a multidisciplinary review of current design of internal process of care and subsequent re-design to improve patient throughput, access to care, assessment and treatment. Improvements have also been recognized through the development of a robust transition of care program led by trained care navigators. The care navigators use condition-specific questionnaires to interview patients within 48 hours of hospital discharge.  Care navigators also act as liaisons between the patient and providers as indicated. In addition, we have created internal reports to monitor the required quality metrics as well as additional metrics identified during process re-design. The internal information has provided monthly data as an indicator of successful intervention or the need to re-examine the process to achieve the desired outcome.",,,
