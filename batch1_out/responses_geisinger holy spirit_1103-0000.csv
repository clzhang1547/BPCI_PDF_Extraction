1103-0000,9.0,This participating ACH has slowly adopted the following practice changes through  an  engaged Clinician group. 1. Utilizing the working DRG list to identify BPCIA patients during the anchor stay; 2. Utilizing a scoring tool to offer guidance in most effective first place destination; 3. Reviewing BPCIA discharge destination data to drive better performance 4. Dedicating case managers to follow impatients without known existing case management during the post- acute episode.,,,

For example, the ACO qualifies the system as an APM and is required to submit signed documents by Providers related to QPP. Now we must do the same for BPCIA. Also, the SNF waiver process has been very different and since we establish that at least half of the Bundles beneficiaries are also tied to ACO we have elected not to use the waiver.",,,
