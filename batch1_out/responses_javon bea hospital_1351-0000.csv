1351-0000,9.0,We have done a nice job keeping track of these patients while they are in the hospital and getting them in to see a primary care provider or other specialist within a week. Our care coordinators are monitoring these patients after discharge with good engagement from most patients.,,,

1351-0000,11.0,"Identifying which patients will eventually be part of the bundle with precision has been challenging. In response, we have been notifying any patient that may fall into it, which has resulted in us notifying a lot of patients about the bundle unnecessarily. We haven't had as many episodes as we have historically, partially due to variation and partially as a result of more accurate coding, which has resulted in more precise DRGs being used more frequently, and thus fewer of these particular episodes. It has been challenging keeping close tabs on the post-discharge care setting usage rather than sending them to a post-acute facility by default. This has led to higher Medicare spending on these patients than we anticipated.",,,

As noted earlier in this questionnaire, we had an LBN change recently that was submitted to CMS via PECOS, but didn't carry over to this CMMI program. We didn't realize that until just now, so we'll get that submitted separately and taken care of. But it is a duplication given that we notified CMS through another channel.

1351-0000,65.0,"We occasionally submit emails to the BPCI mailbox. It would be helpful to have a phone option/helpline as well for more urgent questions, or to explain complicated questions more easily and add context. The MSSP has this and it has proven to be helpful, especially when time is of the essence. It would also be helpful to have a calendar showing when official reports will be issued (especially reconciliation reports). Vague deadlines such as ""this fall"" aren't as helpful for planning purposes (report-out meetings, etc.). The MSSP has a calendar which has been helpful and probably generates fewer emails to CMS asking about the timing.",,,
