We have also reformulated our technology platform to enhance how our partner providers provide patient information so we have more timely access to functional status and social work discharge planning information.",,,

1758-0001,11.0,"Barriers to our success with Care Redesign continues to be post-acute providers who do not provide timely transition and do not adhere to medicare guidelines regarding transition of care.  Also, patients and families who feel entitled to benefits while not understanding the necessary certification for medical necessity.  They feel the surgeon's team is not allowing them to have the care they feel they deserve, rather than understand that they may not qualify for the benefit.   Last, primary care physicians and hospitals who participate in conflicting ACOs or BPCI-A programs themselves who do not adhere to the surgeon's preferences or care plan outlined with the patient pre-operatively, referring patients to poorly performing and/or high cost providers.",,,

Our program approach is built on coordinated care that delivers the medically appropriate standard of safe and high quality interventions on an individualized basis.  Protocol based care can be manipulated. We assign functional progression markers to all of our Care Plans that requires the appropriate duration and intensity of care at all times throughout the full continuum of recovery.First, through the facilitation of IBJI's Orthopaedic Director, Chief Medical Officer, all surgeons will establish a consistent template of care through the electronic health record. This will create a consistent standard of care across IBJI and its partner PGPs that will be shared with our participating partners. Second, we have an active and engaged Quality Assurance Committee comprised of IBJI physician leaders (all interested physicians may attend), the individual service line team leaders and participating PGP organization leaders chaired by our IBJI Orthopaedic Director, Chief Medical Officer. This Quality Assurance Committee meets quarterly to review quality data collected for trending and benchmarking analysis. Reviewed are:    Variations from the established patient protocols;     Comparative clinical and functional outcomes among our contracted partner and non-partner providers: Patient outlier outcomes and adverse event trends Over-utilization and underutilization patterns of service utilization; Patient satisfaction survey and patient call results concerning the patient experience. Third, we provide quarterly quality data to our with our post-acute partner network providers to review individual and aggregate patient results and/or trends impacting patient outcomes. Finally, a quarterly summary report and webinar is held with all our participating surgeons to review and discussion BPCI-A data supported by our BPCI management team.",,,
