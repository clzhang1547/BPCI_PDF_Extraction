1881-0000,9.0,"There has been significant progress in the care transitions process.  During the inpatient stay, all bundle patients are identified as early as possible and are assigned the appropriate educational materials.  A Care Transitions Assistant facilitates the scheduling of post discharge follow up appointments for heart failure and acute myocardial infarction patients.  Future plans include expansion of telehealth visits and use of remote patient monitoring for the heart failure patient population.A COPD Care Transitions RN monitors the inpatient stay of COPD patients and ensures a post discharge appointment is scheduled.  The COPD Care Transitions RN follows patients with follow up telephone calls post discharge.  A distress survey and risk scoring methodology is used for COPD patients that need urgent follow up and/or intervention.  In close collaboration with the COPD Care Transitions RN and clinical team, Lay Navigation is used for this patient population. Structured communication has been developed through the creation of discharge forms by the Care Transitions team and are stored in the electronic health record.  Additionally, EHR messaging for urgent communication needs is used among all UAB providers.  HealtheCare communication is used by the Care Transitions team and a post discharge electronic phone call series is administered to all bundle patients that triggers a nurse follow up as needed.",,,
