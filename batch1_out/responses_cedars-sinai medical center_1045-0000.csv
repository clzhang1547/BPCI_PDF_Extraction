1045-0000,9.0,"Cedars-Sinai has prioritized risk stratification efforts in order to tailor specific interventions to best meet the needs of our patients. We have also implemented care coordination efforts across the continuum of care, including pre-operative outreach for scheduled procedures, inpatient care coordination with close focus on transitions of care, and telephonic follow-up when a patient is at home or in a post-acute facility. Discharge and self-care education, management of comorbid conditions, and appropriate referrals to supportive care medicine have also all been enhanced. Telehealth developments are in process as we consider how to best implement at Cedars-Sinai. Cedars-Sinai is continuing to evaluate screening tools and methods for engaging community partners for social determinants of health.",,,
