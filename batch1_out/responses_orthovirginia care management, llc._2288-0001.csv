Navigating the portal to find documents is not always clear.  Changing of due dates for some things and not others that are typically due together can be confusing.  Not having timely responses to the quarterly updates to the QPP and FAL is a barrier to ensure we have information recorded appropriately.   There have been times that one FAiL report shows a PGP passes one quarter and the PGP fails the next, doesn't make sense. There seems to be some subjective review of these documents.",,,
