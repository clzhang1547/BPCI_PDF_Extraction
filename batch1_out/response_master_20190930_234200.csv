1209-0000,11.0,The notification to beneficiaries is problematic.  The DRGs that drive attribution may not be known before or during a hospitalization.  The procedure delivered in a cath lab and its relationship to the OP PCI bundle may not be known until it is done in the cath lab.  Pretending that the patient has a choice of provider (in or out of bundles) with the exception of planned procedures (joint replacement) is a charade and even when presented ahead of time patients ask if they can be excluded but keep their surgeon.  This whole issue needs to be rethought  immediately and dropped until a better process is identified.,,,

The spinal fusion, non-cervical care pathway extends from the decision for surgery through the 90 day episode. SNF pathways have also been developed and implemented with our system SNFs. - We have introduced a care navigator into the care pathway for the episode patients. The care navigator follows the patient through their episode of care. Preadmission care navigation for the episode patients includes identifying and mitigating risks, educating the patient and family about the procedure, and preparing for discharge. The care navigator addresses some socio-economic barriers to care, including medication affordability, caregiver support, health literacy and transportation, discharge planning. -We have focused on patient engagement and shared decision making for the spinal fusion non-cervical bundle through the inclusion of a mandatory educational class for patient and caregiver. The class is  embedded within preadmission testing. This has resulted in patients being more prepared for surgery, including being fitted in advance for any required bracing to encourage early ambulation within the inpatient stay.-During inpatient stays, we use structured patient communication boards in patient rooms and structured inpatient rounding by managers. -Any readmissions are reviewed by an interdisciplinary group including physicians to address opportunities for improvement.",,,

Furthermore, the delay in confirming eligible episodes and proper bundles creates too much uncertainty, coupled with the fact that we do not have DRG level Target Pricing information for each ACH creates unnecessary challenges to make appropriate and timely value based care-cost decisions for each episode.",,,

This process is informed by our experience implementing care pathways for total joint replacement (knee and hip replacement), coronary artery bypass grafting, spinal fusion and acute myocardial infarction care. Our efforts are focused on creating standard processes in four cycles of care: (1) appropriateness requirements for diagnosis and a trial of nonsurgical care, (2) requirements for fitness for surgery, including documented shared decision making and evaluation of the patients social risks, (3) elements of best practice of surgery, and (4) components for rapid return to function, inclusive of the transition from inpatient to outpatient or home care. Each cycle is guided by current clinical evidence and improvements based on results within each cycle, as tracked by a guiding team for the care pathway. Case managers are assigned to each patient to ensure appropriate transition throughout the pathway and effective beneficiary engagement, and a physician oversight team reviews cases that are deemed challenging for disposition or that fall out due to outcomes not meeting goals.",,,

This will create a consistent standard of care across IBJI and its partner PGPs that will be shared with our participating partners. Second, we have an active and engaged Quality Assurance Committee comprised of IBJI physician leaders (all interested physicians may attend), the individual service line team leaders and participating PGP organization leaders chaired by our IBJI Orthopaedic Director, Chief Medical Officer. This Quality Assurance Committee meets quarterly to review quality data collected for trending and benchmarking analysis. Reviewed are:    Variations from the established patient protocols;     Comparative clinical and functional outcomes among our contracted partner and non-partner providers: Patient outlier outcomes and adverse event trends Over-utilization and underutilization patterns of service utilization; Patient satisfaction survey and patient call results concerning the patient experience.

1764-0001,65.0,"Retrospective (instead of prospective) based reimbursement structure puts enormous strain on non-convener participants funding cost of proper operations, care support, and in evaluating additional resources necessary to implement appropriate care and other non-covered requirements for the patients. For example, the lack of a list of CPT codes qualifying under each DRG that would trigger services.  Furthermore, the delay in confirming eligible episodes and proper bundles creates too much uncertainty, coupled with the fact that we do not have DRG level Target Pricing information for each ACH creates unnecessary challenges to make appropriate and timely value based care-cost decisions for each episode.",,,

We have developed clinical pathways for our newest clinical episodes within BPCI-A, most notably for patients with cellulitis, collaborating closely with our Infectious Disease specialist to ensure these patients are on the appropriate antibiotics and have close medical follow-up after discharge from the hospital to prevent re-hospitalizations.  We have strengthened clinical pathways built in BPCI Model 2 for patients with CHF which now serves as the standard of care for all patients with CHF admitted to our hospital.  Optimization of our new EMR includes implementation of the LACE tool to assess risk for readmission in all patients and hardwiring tracking codes for advanced care planning.",,,

In clinical episodes for GI Hemorrhage our team reports that patients are often taking anticoagulants and that these typically contribute to and often complicate GI Hemorrhage, creating challenges for management throughout the episode.  Finally, our team is most proud of outcomes achieved after managing clinical episodes for CHF since 2015, namely reducing readmissions to LGH from 22% in 2017 to 20% in 2018 and17% in 2019 to-date.",,,

Final DRGs are not assigned until discharge and working DRGs are not always accurate.  We have had no visibility into which beneficiaries are in an ACO or MSSP arrangement (and thus excluded), and remain unclear about when ESRD does or does not exclude beneficiaries from a clinical episode.  The frustration associated with this, and the daily task of identifying patients, can lead to burnout among members of the team.  A second significant challenge has been that clinical episode volume is much lower than in BPCI Model 2 and much lower than predicted primarily due to the exclusion of beneficiaries involved in an ACO or MSSP, and the proliferation of these programs in the region.  Lower patient volumes in each clinical episode make achievement of savings much more difficult, increase the hospital's risk, and decrease likelihood of continuing in the program.",,,

Our practice has noticed that it is challenging to accurately identify BPCI patients in advance or in near-real time, due to either patient Medicare enrollment status changes or other reasons providers do not have insight into.  2. CMS recently addressed the TAVR following PCI issue in the new rule. However, Mitral Clip following PCI was not. Our practice still has a concern that Mitral Clips could potentially impact our PCI-OP performance as we are seeing an upward trend recently. 3. Watchman devices and PCIs share a DRG, but Watchmans are much more costly than PCI internally and recommend CMS consider different DRGs.",,,

BPCI Advanced has proven to be a good platform from which to encourage change, giving Michigan Medicine a concrete set of conditions/surgeries for which to pilot certain interventions.

The cardiac physician champion, the cardiac clinical manager (a physician assistant) and the AMI navigator are all highly committed and now experienced.  In the last 5 months we have added a cardiac pharmacist, who handles discharge medication reconciliation on all AMI patients, and follows-up with them post-discharge.  We have also added a cardiac exercise physiologist who helps AMI patients craft individualized exercise programs.  We have clinical data support for analyzing the claims data.  The Executive Leadership Team is highly engaged at our BPCI Steering Council.",,,

5229-0000,11.0,"We are working on the CarePort EMR software that would notify us if patients get admitted elsewhere, but this module is not yet installed in several of the regional hospitals where our AMI patients get their local care. Thus unless patients tell us (and we do ask), we are not always aware of ER Visits and Readmissions to other hospitals, until we get the CMS claims data well after the care delivery.  The Telehealth patient tools have been not as robust as desired, nor as accepted by patients as hoped.  Addressing socio-economic barriers to care is an every day challenge.  There can be gaps in the post-acute collaboration (e.g. one patient spent 44 days in a SNF outside our state).",,,

To mitigate this challenge, our team visits each ACH facility quarterly to share critical program information and education that has been created to detail agreement and quality requirements. A BPCIA community site, for the purpose of education, has been created internally at the UH Digital Workplace, and bi-weekly meetings have been held with Division Chiefs to assist in delivery of accurate details to their physician teams. In addition, the Medical Director of BPCIA frequently engages with physicians and ACH partners to share updates for process and procedure while the Administrative Director collaborates to share financial updates as well as post-acute utilization metrics.Another challenge has been the requirement that we enter Participating Practitioner Agreement for providers that we designate as QPPs.  With 37 episode combinations across 9 hospitals, we have many providers involved in our BPCIA program.  It is very difficult to obtain agreements with all of the providers.  We would prefer a process were we provide a notice to the provider, educating them about the BPCIA program, and the fact that we intend to include them on the QPP list.

Prior to BPCIA, our team established communications and care coordination efforts with physicians and post-acute providers including primary care providers and community resources. Further, we established a care management structure that allowed for the identification of high risk patients, tracking of the patient's status across the episode and care coordination with an assigned clinical resource (e.g. patient navigator) for the duration of the bundle.
