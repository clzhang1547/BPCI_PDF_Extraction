2272-0000,9.0,"We have focused on bundle governance, clinician engagement, and systems infrastructure build to forward our clinical redesign plan.  To that end we have formed and chartered and Episodes of Care Executive Steering Committee.  Similarly, we have identified clinical champions to lead bundled payment care redesign efforts within their respective clinical services.  Finally, we have focused our infrastructure development work on five key system level areas to effectively improve quality and cost in episodes of care.  Those areas include 1) Analytics, 2) Care Coordination, 3) Post Acute Care partnerships, 4) Information services (EMR workflows), and 5) Telehealth.",,,

2272-0000,11.0,Not having a clear indication of which episodes will drop due to overlapping logic has been problematic in providing accurate case data to clinicians as having mis identified cases can discourage physician engagement.  Claims based quality measure reporting has been a challenge with respect to ACP and Periop Antibiotic measures as we have had to identify and build new workflows to capture this activity.  Those are not complete and the moment and are concerning with respect to CQS performance.,,,
