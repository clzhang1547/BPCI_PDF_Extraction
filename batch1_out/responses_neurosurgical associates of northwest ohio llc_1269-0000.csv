1269-0000,9.0,"- We have worked closely with physicians and other members of an interdisciplinary team to establish and implement a diagnosis- triggered clinical care pathway for the episode. The spinal fusion, non-cervical care pathway extends from the decision for surgery through the 90 day episode. SNF pathways have also been developed and implemented with our system SNFs. - We have introduced a care navigator into the care pathway for the episode patients. The care navigator follows the patient through their episode of care. Preadmission care navigation for the episode patients includes identifying and mitigating risks, educating the patient and family about the procedure, and preparing for discharge. The care navigator addresses some socio-economic barriers to care, including medication affordability, caregiver support, health literacy and transportation, discharge planning. -We have focused on patient engagement and shared decision making for the spinal fusion non-cervical bundle through the inclusion of a mandatory educational class for patient and caregiver. The class is  embedded within preadmission testing. This has resulted in patients being more prepared for surgery, including being fitted in advance for any required bracing to encourage early ambulation within the inpatient stay.-During inpatient stays, we use structured patient communication boards in patient rooms and structured inpatient rounding by managers. -Any readmissions are reviewed by an interdisciplinary group including physicians to address opportunities for improvement.",,,
