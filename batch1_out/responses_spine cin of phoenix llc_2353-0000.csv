For example, the lack of a list of CPT codes qualifying under each DRG that would trigger services.  Furthermore, the delay in confirming eligible episodes and proper bundles creates too much uncertainty, coupled with the fact that we do not have DRG level Target Pricing information for each ACH creates unnecessary challenges to make appropriate and timely value based care-cost decisions for each episode.",,,
