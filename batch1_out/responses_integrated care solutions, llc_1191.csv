1191,9.0,"ICS combines a people-driven and technology-driven care coordination model to redesign care. The primary priority for implementation has been a significant investment in a technology product which ICS has built from scratch to enable, optimize and improve the nurses in the field who are actively managing patients and working alongside care teams. Secondly, ICS continues to enhance our clinical assessments and risk assessments to enable auto-populated 90-day care plans that are based on evidence-based guidelines, symptoms management/identification and expected outcomes - there has been significant enhancements to the clinical care model and 90-day care plans in 2019. Finally, ICS works closely with hospital(s) to transform the hospital discharge planning process which is an ongoing effort and involves everything from determining optimal first PAC setting of care to ensuring patients are treated in the highest quality providers in the market.",,,

1191,11.0,"ICS BPID 1191 experienced a significant change in practicing hospital by our PGP partners shifting almost completely from one hospital provider to another during BPCI-A implementation. This has required significant operational and implementation effort to bring the new hospital leadership and key physicians onboard with the BPCI-A program and meaningfully engage in care redesign efforts. Additionally, this has resulted in unknown target prices given this change throughout the performance period, leaving ICS with a significant ""blindspot"" around projected results via the monthly claims files received to date.",,,
