5159-0001,9.0,"CHF patients listed as first ""high priority care redesign"" because of readmit risks identified. We are doing ongoing collaborative work with cardiology/geriatric/pharmacy provider services clinics on patient touch points. CHF patients now followed through 90 day episodes with nursing care coordinator.  Fascia iliaca blocks started on Hip/Femur patients.  Anesthesiologist/ER providers trained.  Goals to reduce opioid use, constipation, delirium in hip/femur fracture patients.",,,

5159-0001,11.0,"Successes in addition to the CHF patient care and fascia iliaca blocks include IT building infrastructure for us to track our patients and assign risk levels for LOS and readmits that can be used by nursing care coordinators in following patients.  In addition, probable DRG codes by nursing review is moved to an MPage in Cerner so that patients can be met during their InPatient stay and given the guarantor letter and warm handoff to the nursing care coordinator.  Initial challenges on care redesign interventions have been around how to track the patients through the various EMR systems and creating a way to document the patients through their complete 90 day episodes.  Bringing understanding about the BPCI program and how it works has been somewhat resolved by created an easy to read explanation of the program to various clinics we are working with.  We have started meeting with the skilled nursing facilities after completing a quality scoring system for each based on their previous care of our Medicare patients to set up care expectations for our BPCI patients.",,,

5159-0001,54.0,Excited providers especially when implementing the fascia iliaca blocks for the Hip/Femur patients.  Brought anesthesiologists and ER providers together for training and implementation.  Hospitalists very interested in following the program along with cardiology.  Found the providers are very interested in seeing the data and improving outcomes.  One unexpected outcome is being able to tie together current quality processes into BPCI as all patients will be able to benefit from the pathways created.  Finally seeing SNFs and other outside resources interested in improving their quality for the BPCI patients.,,,
