1209-0000,11.0,The notification to beneficiaries is problematic.  The DRGs that drive attribution may not be known before or during a hospitalization.  The procedure delivered in a cath lab and its relationship to the OP PCI bundle may not be known until it is done in the cath lab.  Pretending that the patient has a choice of provider (in or out of bundles) with the exception of planned procedures (joint replacement) is a charade and even when presented ahead of time patients ask if they can be excluded but keep their surgeon.  This whole issue needs to be rethought  immediately and dropped until a better process is identified.,,,
