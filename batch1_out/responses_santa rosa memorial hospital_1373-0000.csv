1373-0000,9.0,"Santa Rosa's high priority Care Redesign Intervention was around shared decision-making, specifically pertaining to the pre-operative and 90 day post-acute time frame.  In addition to the current Total Joint Patient Navigator, a new role entitled the ""Bundled Payment Care Manager"" was created.  The focus of the Bundled Payment Care Manager is to guide and coordinate high and rising risk patients through multiple care delivery systems, with emphasis on training the providers and downstream episode participants (SNF, Home Care, OP Physical Therapy) on implementation of patient risk screening/risk mitigation tools, in addition to engaging patient's family/caregiver/coach in the decision making process.",,,

Challenges/barriers arise with our extensive geographic reach and rural settings which make it even more evident that our strategy around the Bundled Payment Care Manager role being necessary for the pre-operative optimization of the patient and the success of the overall program in terms of outcomes, readmission reduction and patient satisfaction.",,,

1373-0000,65.0,"Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital is participating in BPCI-A for Lower Extremity Joint Replacement and Upper Extremity Joint Replacement.  The main challenges that we have found with the Lower Extremity Joint Replacement cohort is that hip fracture/hemiarthroplasty patients are included in this group.  Although risk adjusted, the majority of this patient population is high acuity and requires great resources (lengthy hospital LOS, extended SNF stays, multiple comorbidities, higher incidence of readmission) and as a result, this non-elective population is straining the target bundle price. Our recommendation or ask would be that for this Clinical Episode, as with all BPCI-A Clinical Episodes, CMS apply a target price per DRG, and possibly even broken out by (in this case) w/ and w/o fractures. This would account for the patient acuity, and be more appropriate.",,,
