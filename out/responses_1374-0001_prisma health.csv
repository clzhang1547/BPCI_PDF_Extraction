1374-0001,9.0,"On the whole, our practice is on track to meet our high priority care redesign areas.  We have focused our care redesign efforts on consolidating order sets by disease states among three different EMRs with the goal of reducing variation while also improving quality and decreasing cost.  Additionally, we are redesigning post-discharge care through the use of a care management program, a transitions clinic, TCM/discharge follow up visits, and development of a post-acute network of vested partners.  We have also implemented a community referral system to address socioeconomic barriers.",,,
