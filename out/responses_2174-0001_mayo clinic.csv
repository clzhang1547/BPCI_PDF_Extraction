2174-0001,65.0,"1. Our practice has noticed that it is challenging to accurately identify BPCI patients in advance or in near-real time, due to either patient Medicare enrollment status changes or other reasons providers do not have insight into.  2. CMS recently addressed the TAVR following PCI issue in the new rule. However, Mitral Clip following PCI was not. Our practice still has a concern that Mitral Clips could potentially impact our PCI-OP performance as we are seeing an upward trend recently. 3. Watchman devices and PCIs share a DRG, but Watchmans are much more costly than PCI internally and recommend CMS consider different DRGs.",,,
