1751-0001,9.0,"Confluence Health and Wenatchee Valley Medical Group are working to implement care pathways for cardiac arrythmia and stroke. This process is informed by our experience implementing care pathways for total joint replacement (knee and hip replacement), coronary artery bypass grafting, spinal fusion and acute myocardial infarction care. Our efforts are focused on creating standard processes in four cycles of care: (1) appropriateness requirements for diagnosis and a trial of nonsurgical care, (2) requirements for fitness for surgery, including documented shared decision making and evaluation of the patients social risks, (3) elements of best practice of surgery, and (4) components for rapid return to function, inclusive of the transition from inpatient to outpatient or home care. Each cycle is guided by current clinical evidence and improvements based on results within each cycle, as tracked by a guiding team for the care pathway. Case managers are assigned to each patient to ensure appropriate transition throughout the pathway and effective beneficiary engagement, and a physician oversight team reviews cases that are deemed challenging for disposition or that fall out due to outcomes not meeting goals.",,,
