To date, Sutter's analysis of episodes of care within our system has revealed process variability in the utilization of skilled-nursing and acute-rehabilitation services that does not appear to be related to patient characteristics.Participation in the BPCI-A program is enabling Sutter to reexamine all aspects of episodic care, from pre-operative patient education through post-discharge home health and outpatient therapy, to standardizeour processes for ensuring each patient receives the appropriate level of post-acute care throughout the clinical episode.",,,
