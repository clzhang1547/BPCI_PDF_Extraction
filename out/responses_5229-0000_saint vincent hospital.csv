5229-0000,9.0,"The Epic clinical EMR is very supportive of care being delivered for the initial acute episode, and for follow-up care by the AMI nurse navigator and care team, and into the physician offices of our collaborators.  We have developed the ability to get reports on all patients coded to an AMI DRG, who will thus be in the BPCI program.  Our AMI care team has gained great experience following patients across their 90 day episodes.  The cardiac physician champion, the cardiac clinical manager (a physician assistant) and the AMI navigator are all highly committed and now experienced.  In the last 5 months we have added a cardiac pharmacist, who handles discharge medication reconciliation on all AMI patients, and follows-up with them post-discharge.  We have also added a cardiac exercise physiologist who helps AMI patients craft individualized exercise programs.  We have clinical data support for analyzing the claims data.  The Executive Leadership Team is highly engaged at our BPCI Steering Council.",,,

5229-0000,11.0,"We are working on the CarePort EMR software that would notify us if patients get admitted elsewhere, but this module is not yet installed in several of the regional hospitals where our AMI patients get their local care. Thus unless patients tell us (and we do ask), we are not always aware of ER Visits and Readmissions to other hospitals, until we get the CMS claims data well after the care delivery.  The Telehealth patient tools have been not as robust as desired, nor as accepted by patients as hoped.  Addressing socio-economic barriers to care is an every day challenge.  There can be gaps in the post-acute collaboration (e.g. one patient spent 44 days in a SNF outside our state).",,,

5229-0000,65.0,"While a report was developed within our EMR to identify BPCI-Adv patients, there has been difficulty in successfully performing Advanced Care Planning (ACP), CPT 99497-99498. The challenges encompass the workflow (difficult to have discussion in every patient instance) and coding & documentation to support the coding requirements (discussion time length to meet of at least 30 minutes).If the patient is not expected to expire from an AMI and the clinician begins the ACP discussion, the patient may become scared of a 'death panel' and/or declines an ACP.  It can be a quick 2-minute discussion and does not meet the code's requirements to bill it.",,,
