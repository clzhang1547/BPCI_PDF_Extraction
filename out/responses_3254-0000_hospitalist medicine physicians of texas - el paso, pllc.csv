We have developed an IT platform to collect data on each patient participating in the BPCIA program to monitor their next site of care, readmissions (all NSOC locations and root cause DRGs), SNF length of stay, SNF readmissions, use of high quality network agencies and facilities, and alignment with patient clinical desires of care with advance care planning.  We use our analytics to evaluate the outcomes of our patients in order to adjust our future interventions involving our physicians, nurses, care coordinating team, outpatient resources, and etc.  Our clinical team evaluates our patient care while in the acute setting and in the post acute setting for a 90 day window.  We have nurses, physicians, and care coordinators that link the care in the acute to the post acute setting to mitigate and monitor outcomes and possible unintended consequences.  This care team is integrated into our data and communication platforms to help drive performance and outcomes for each of our patients.",,,

We have noticed that we do not receive all the notifications from CMS for each participant via email, whether it be general notifications, updates, or action items that are due in specific time-frame.  Due to this, we would need to check each BPID to make sure that the ""Action Item"" notifications pertain to one or all. In this case, we received ACQ action items for 10 BPIDs, out of 78, but in reviewing the portal we need to submit for all 78 BPIDs.",,,
