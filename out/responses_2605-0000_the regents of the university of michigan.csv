2605-0000,9.0,"Michigan Medicine continues to pursue sharing unblinded provider-level data with providers and teams in a variety of settings. Specifically related to BPCI Advanced, Michigan Medicine has started sharing unblinded discharge disposition data with surgeons in order to identify outliers and change culture around discharge disposition. There is interest in sharing similar data with Hospital Medicine physicians in order to impact discharge disposition for medical bundles as well. Michigan Medicine continues to pursue internal cost accounting. Cost drivers have been identified through close observations and time studies, and labor and supply costs are currently being validated. Costing reports have been developed for a select number of conditions, and data will be live for the entire institution in early 2020. Michigan Medicine is still in the pilot phase for collecting Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) with Orthopedic Surgery. Michigan Medicine still plan to roll out this process to the entire institution with generic PROM questionnaires, but the process has been delayed due to a change in physician champion.",,,

2605-0000,11.0,"The challenges of implementing care redesign interventions at Michigan Medicine are often related to the pace of implementation. Michigan Medicine is a large, integrated health system and we implement interventions in a payer-agnostic manner. This results in more sustainable and meaningful interventions, but takes time to implement across diverse patient populations and departments. BPCI Advanced has proven to be a good platform from which to encourage change, giving Michigan Medicine a concrete set of conditions/surgeries for which to pilot certain interventions. For example, we have implemented Pharmacy Transition of Care calls for all Sepsis discharges, regardless of a patient's LACE score. Additionally, we have enhanced engagement from clinical champions, which leads to an interest in sharing data and setting goals for improvement.",,,

We began collecting signed agreements from Participating Practitioners at that point, and have successfully submitted a QPP list with those who have signed agreements. We are pursuing obtaining written agreements from the remainder of providers who have engaged in BPCI Advanced activities, and are partnering with each Clinical Department to stress the importance of obtaining written agreements from the impacted providers. This is a new process for Michigan Medicine, and we have engaged Executive leadership to move the process along as quickly as possible.",,,

While there has always been interest in this utilization measure from a patient outcomes and capacity management perspective, BPCI Advanced has added another financial benefit to impacting this measure beyond the other total cost of care programs in which we participate.
