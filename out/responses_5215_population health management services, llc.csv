Our clinical team includes 3 RNs (Director, Manager, Staff Nurse) that are all familiar with the care management processes.  These nurses are further supported by a physician.  If any one of these nurses left, the others could pull together to keep our processes in place until a replacement could be found and hired.  On the administrative side, we have a Director and VP that share responsibilities which are also supported by a physician (same physician that supports the clinical area).",,,

This committee consists of neuro science physicians, nurse practitioners, hospitalists, hospital administrators, care management, quality management and physical and occupational therapy. This working group has helped resolved several process issues that were impacting care for stroke patients that were part of the BPCI-A program as well as non-BPCI patients.  Providing data on utilization to the groups has spurred healthy discussion on how to make improvements on placing patients post discharge as well as how to avoid unnecessary ED visits and how to better manage patients that do return to the ED.",,,

That said, the overwhelming amount of email and communication about BPCI-A makes it difficult to suss out what is urgent or has a deadline from simply informative information.  In the MSSP ACO program, we have a newsletter that highlights all important changes and we have a liaison that meets with us regularly by telephone to keep us on track of what needs to be done.
