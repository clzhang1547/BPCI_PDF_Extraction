1106-0000,9.0,This participating ACH has eagerly adopted the following practice changes through  a strongly engaged Clinician group. 1. Utilizing the working DRG list to identify BPCIA patients during the anchor stay; 2. Utilizing a scoring tool to offer guidance in most effective first place destination;  3. Reviewing BPCIA discharge destination data to drive better performance 4. Dedicated case managers to follow beneficiaries without Geisnger-employed PCPs/case management. 5. Offering at-home services to complex COPD population.,,,

We also found that only about 1/3 of BPCI Classic beneficiaries chose a partnering EIP. Therefor we have chosen not to gain share with EIPS at this time.",,,

For example, the ACO qualifies the system as an APM and is required to submit signed documents by Providers related to QPP. Now we must do the same for BPCIA. Also, the SNF waiver process has been very different and since we establish that at least half of the Bundles beneficiaries are also tied to ACO we have elected not to use the waiver.",,,
