5330-0001,9.0,"Since October 1, 2018, care redesign initiatives have focused on ensuring that patients receive the right care, for the right reason, and for the right period of time during their episode of care.  This has meant assessing preoperative risk to drive optimization prior to surgery as well as purposeful comprehensive patient care management during the post-acute phase.  Care redesign is largely complete but will be ongoing throughout the program.",,,

There is very little reason from their perspective to spend their time reviewing, making potential changes to, and executing an agreement of this nature.  When an episode initiator is a hospital who has chosen not to gainshare financially downstream but is now required as of Q4 2019 to have non-financial participation agreements in place, it is very burdensome.",,,
