The UH BPCIA team has engaged the High Reliability Medicine staff to collaborate with  Division Chiefs of 21 disease groups in order to standardize clinical pathway guidelines, EMR ordersets, delivery of care, patient education, and primary care physician education. In addition, hospital ancillary teams have been engaged in order to create standardized patient mobility scoring systems to assist in discharging patients to the appropriate next site of care and to begin early ambulation in hopes of minimizing deconditioning. Last, multiple oversight committees and project teams have been established to lead and monitor operations, quality and safety, as well as patient education."

There has been a great deal of collegial spirit as our subject matter experts focus on enhancing acute care delivered to our patients as well as ensuring patients are discharged to the appropriate location to further their healing. We are excited when considering the efforts being placed in redesigning our care plans and standardizing processes across the health system.

5397-0001,18,4,Partner Agreements,Please use the comment box below to describe any challenges in implementing process and procedures to monitor agreements or in establishing agreements with partners.,"The biggest challenge experienced is simply the lack of BPCIA education amongst partners. To mitigate this challenge, our team visits each ACH facility quarterly to share critical program information and education that has been created to detail agreement and quality requirements. A BPCIA community site, for the purpose of education, has been created internally at the UH Digital Workplace, and bi-weekly meetings have been held with Division Chiefs to assist in delivery of accurate details to their physician teams. In addition, the Medical Director of BPCIA frequently engages with physicians and ACH partners to share updates for process and procedure while the Administrative Director collaborates to share financial updates as well as post-acute utilization metrics.Another challenge has been the requirement that we enter Participating Practitioner Agreement for providers that we designate as QPPs.  With 37 episode combinations across 9 hospitals, we have many providers involved in our BPCIA program.  It is very difficult to obtain agreements with all of the providers.  We would prefer a process were we provide a notice to the provider, educating them about the BPCIA program, and the fact that we intend to include them on the QPP list.  At that point, they could choose to opt out and we would not include them on the list."

After much consideration, willingness to assume financial risk stemmed from our experience in other value based payment models such as Medicare Shared Savings and BPCI. Prior to BPCIA, our team established communications and care coordination efforts with physicians and post-acute providers including primary care providers and community resources. Further, we established a care management structure that allowed for the identification of high risk patients, tracking of the patient's status across the episode and care coordination with an assigned clinical resource (e.g. patient navigator) for the duration of the bundle. All of these efforts were designed to focus on improving beneficiary outcomes and experience, and used to influence policy and practice within our organization. We continue to work with our post-acute and community partners in the development of common practices and processes."

We have been pleasantly surprised by the thoughtful participation of our colleagues as we all strive to improve patient outcomes and build framework for care processes. Being highly visible, and taking a caring approach, our team has been used as the ""sounding board"" for staff and physician concerns; I believe this results from our ability to build meaningful relationships of trust and transparency, which have proven to be highly respected despite the information delivered to our colleagues being negative at times. When negative communication has been delivered, we have witnessed a competitive spirit emerge resulting in teams brainstorming to quickly resolve identified problems...a bit of friendly rivalry throughout the health system.

The process scorecards provide a weekly visual of performance by facility and disease group and encompass reduction in skilled nursing usage using evidence-based mobility assessment prior to discharge, increasing in Home w/ or w/out Home Health support for those patients who should be discharged home, and ensuring patients are following up with their physicians within seven days of discharge to enforce medication adherence, mitigate disease process concerns, and reduce readmissions. The monthly scorecards focus on 30- and 90-day patient outcomes relating to length of stay, mortality, readmissions, and cost. In addition, an interactive BPCIA quality dashboard is currently being created to track all BPCIA quality metrics to ensure we mitigate unintended consequence of the model."

Numerous emails have been sent from CMS regarding the program this year, all of which are confusing in one way or the other, and leave us wondering what is being asked of our team. In addition, we are finding it challenging to receive timely responses from the CMS Innovation team especially when the ask for clarification is attached to a submission deadline. Could be improvement in this process as well."
